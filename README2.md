JMLS Market is an open source application for New York real estate market run on blockchain technology.

This market serves to raise funds for the JMLS real estate development project by auctioning property to the masses. We were able to make this virtual auction by tokenizing properties and making it available to the public via our website. 

[JMLS Website](https://janetcheung-byte.github.io/JMLS_market/frontend/index.html#)

Real Estate sample data was gathered from NYC.gov. Using the Block and Lot data we found, we tokenized the properties to the blockchain

We then created a Smart Contract using Solidity. 

Our private blockchain network is run on a proof of authority algorithm. 

The auctioning can be accessed by anyone via our frontend website.
